# ConfigArc Launcher

Unofficial visual configuration and launcher for arcade titles using `segatools.ini`. Built with Tauri (Rust backend) and React + TypeScript (Vite) frontend.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js + npm
- Rust toolchain
- Tauri CLI (`npm install -D @tauri-apps/cli`)

## Usage
```bash
npm install
npm run tauri dev
```

This starts the Vite dev server and the Tauri shell so you can edit configs, manage profiles, and launch games with selected profiles.
